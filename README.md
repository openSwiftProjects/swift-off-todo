# [Swift Off :rocket:](http://goprimer.github.io/swift-off/)

Swift Off is a boilerplate project for Xcode which makes it easy to get started building an iOS app using Swift. It's a great starting point for any new app. We've already included several standard SDKs and setup all the boring stuff, so you can just focus on building the core of your app!

This is a fully completed To Do app that has been built ontop of the [Swift Off Boilerplate](https://github.com/goprimer/swift-off).

You can read the [full tutorial here](https://github.com/goprimer/swift-off/wiki/Awesome-To-Do-App-Tutorial), which has a step by step guide to building this To Do App!
